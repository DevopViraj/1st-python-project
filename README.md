# 1st-python-project
This is my first python project. It is a simple python calculator program which can perform certain operations like: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division. It takes input from user allowing it to enter multiple values and able to exit any time managing wrong input from user. It also provides good user feedback.
